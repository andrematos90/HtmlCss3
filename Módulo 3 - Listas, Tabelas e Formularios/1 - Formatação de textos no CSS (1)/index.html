    <p>Needless to say, I keep her in check
        She was all bad-bad, nevertheless
        Calling it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck
        Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck
        Needless to say, I keep her in check
        She was all bad-bad, nevertheless
        Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck
        Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck
        Thinking in a bad way, losing your grip
        Screaming at my face, baby, don't trip
        Someone took a big L, I don't know how that felt
        Looking at you sideways, party on tilt
        Some things you just can't refuse
        She wanna ride like a cruise and I'm not tryna lose
        
        Then you're left in the dust
        Unless I stuck by ya
        You're a sunflower
        I think your love would be too much
        Or you'll be left in the dust
        Unless I stuck by ya

        [Post Malone]
        Every time I'm leaving on ya
        You don't make it easy, no
        Wish I could be there for you
        Give me a reason to go
        Every time I'm walking out
        I can hear you telling me to turn around
        Fighting for my trust and you won't back down
        Even if we gotta risk it all right now, oh
        I know you're scared of the unknown
        You don't wanna be alone
        I know I always come and go
        But it's out of my control
       </p>
       
       <p>
        And you'll be left in the dust
        Unless I stuck by ya
        You're the sunflower
        I think your love would be too much
        Or you'll be left in the dust
        Unless I stuck by ya
        You're the sunflower
        You're the sunflower
